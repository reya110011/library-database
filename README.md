# local library database system

### problem statement
> A local library wants to keep track of the books they have in their collection.

> they want to be able to store the book `title`, `author`, and `publication year`, as well as keep track of which books are currently checked out to users

### solution 
> to solve this problem, a database can be designed to store infor,mation about the books in the library collection.

this database will have a table called `books` which will store the information about the each book:  

**Book** 
- `title`     : the title of book
- `author`    : the name of the author of the book 
- `publication year`    : the year  book was published
- `checked out` : a indicating value whether the book is currently checked out to user or not
